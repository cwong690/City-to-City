# City-to-City
Comparison of Wick Park, Chicago, IL to Queen Anne and Capitol Hill, Seattle, WA

Moving to another city is always exciting but also comes with a lot of decisions. One of the biggest decisions is: where should I live?
The area you live can greatly impact your first impression of the new city, not to mention it's a decision you HAVE to make before you move!
Some people lived in busy places and would like a change of pace when they move. Others would like the same energy they lived around in their old city! This project is to help compare certain neighbourhoods between two cities (in this case, Chicago and Seattle) and help see which areas are similar and which ones might be the complete opposite.

After doing some neighbourhood research, we will compare the neighbourhood to move from, Wicker Park in Chicago, to Capitol Hill in Seattle and then also Queen Anne in Seattle.
